# DailyTask
This is a program I'm working on which is based upon "Task Manager (haha)", a program I wrote a few years ago. The original has a lot of bugs, and I mean: A LOT. Therefore I aspire to be better in programming its successor, which I do to train programming, be able to fully control what this program does and adjust it to my needs.
